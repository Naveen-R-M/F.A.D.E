2025-07-24 16:13:08 - root - INFO - Processing query 1/5: I'm looking for potential drug candidates that could target the KRAS G12D mutant protein, which is implicated in pancreatic cancer. The molecules should be able to cross the blood-brain barrier, have low toxicity, and follow Lipinski's rule of five for drug-likeness. I'm particularly interested in molecules that might bind to the GTP binding pocket of KRAS to inhibit its activity.
