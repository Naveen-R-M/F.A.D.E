# F.A.D.E Platform Context & Information

## Platform Overview

F.A.D.E (Fully Agentic Drug Engine) is an AI-powered drug discovery platform that transforms natural language queries into comprehensive computational drug discovery workflows. The platform uses multiple specialized AI agents to handle different aspects of the drug discovery process, from target identification to lead optimization.

## How F.A.D.E Works

### 1. Query Processing
Users submit drug discovery goals in natural language. The system analyzes queries to extract:
- Target proteins or biological pathways
- Disease context and therapeutic area
- Molecular property requirements
- Specific mutations or resistance mechanisms
- Administration preferences (oral, IV, etc.)

### 2. Multi-Agent Pipeline
F.A.D.E employs specialized AI agents that work together:

**Target Selector Agent:**
- Processes natural language to identify protein targets
- Retrieves protein sequences from UniProt database
- Generates configuration files for structure prediction

**Structure Predictor Agent:**
- Uses AlphaFold3 for 3D protein structure prediction
- Searches RCSB PDB for existing experimental structures
- Analyzes structural quality and confidence scores
- Identifies potential binding sites and pockets

**Molecule Generator Agent:**
- Creates potential drug candidates using AI guidance
- Generates chemically valid molecular structures
- Applies medicinal chemistry principles and drug-likeness filters
- Uses RDKit for molecular property calculations

**Evaluator Agent:**
- Assesses drug-like properties (ADMET)
- Applies Lipinski's Rule of Five and other drug-likeness criteria
- Predicts blood-brain barrier penetration, solubility, toxicity
- Scores molecules based on specified requirements

**Docking Agent:**
- Performs molecular docking simulations
- Uses AutoDock Vina or Schrodinger Glide
- Calculates binding affinities and poses
- Analyzes protein-ligand interactions

**Refiner Agent:**
- Iteratively improves molecules based on docking results
- Suggests structural modifications for better binding
- Optimizes drug properties through multiple refinement cycles
- Learns from previous iterations to improve suggestions

### 3. Computational Infrastructure
- **HPC Integration:** Runs on high-performance computing clusters with SLURM scheduling
- **GPU Resources:** Uses V100, A100, and H200 GPUs for structure prediction
- **Workflow Management:** Nextflow pipelines for robust execution and monitoring
- **Scalable Architecture:** Can process multiple targets simultaneously
