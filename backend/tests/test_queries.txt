# F.A.D.E Test Queries
# Format: One query per line

# Basic query with single target and mutation
Find molecules targeting KRAS G12D with good BBB permeability

# Detailed query with multiple requirements
I'm looking for potential drug candidates that could target the KRAS G12D mutant protein, which is implicated in pancreatic cancer. The molecules should be able to cross the blood-brain barrier, have low toxicity, and follow Lipinski's rule of five for drug-likeness.

# Query with binding site specification
Design inhibitors for KRAS G12D that bind to the GTP binding pocket and can cross the blood-brain barrier.

# Different target with mutation
Find molecules that inhibit BRAF V600E with good BBB permeability and low toxicity.

# Query with multiple protein targets
Develop dual inhibitors for both EGFR and HER2 that can cross the blood-brain barrier.

# Target with specific organism
Design compounds that block human ACE2 receptor binding to viral spike proteins while maintaining BBB permeability.

# Query with complex property requirements
Find KRAS G12D inhibitors with BBB permeability, water solubility above 100 mg/L, and metabolic stability with t1/2 > 3 hours in human liver microsomes.
